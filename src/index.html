              Now it's possible to rewind time but.. only a short distance.. or is it time?

              tf2nerds is, maybe, the best TF2 community ever created!
              That's right. Maybe. Nobody really knows and frankly we have serious doubts.
              That being said, we'd love for you to become a part of our community!
              You can do so by joining our <a href="https://discord.gg/kEgvMAgpDt" target="_blank">discord</a>
              or playing on our <a href="servers.html">servers!</a>
